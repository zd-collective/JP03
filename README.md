# JP03
The goal of this project was to keep the aesthetics of the original JP01 by overset (and by extension, the JP02 run by JLabs) while redoing the internals and adding an optimized plate. 

The PCB is a modification of andygunn's mod of FateNozomi's Arisu. I just put two holes so that the plate could work without pushing the two middle-top mounting points up, and reuploaded it in the PCB folder. All credit goes to FateNozomi and andygunn for the design.
